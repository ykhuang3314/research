Begin Incremental Netlisting Apr  5 14:50:35 2021
WARNING (OSSHNL-269): Variable 'simModelNamePrefix' is not defined in the current netlisting session. It had a value
'_unl' last time netlisting was done in current run directory. Netlists from last
session cannot be used for incremental netlisting. Therefore re-netlisting the
design.

Netlist Warning: The netlisting procedure specified for (GATES_HD nand2 schematic) is 
obsolete. You can convert your library with the 
Tools - Conversion Tool Box menu on the CIW. 

WARNING (ADE-6003): Terminal "gnd", specified in the CDF termOrder, does not exist
           in the cell-view "Stimulator_IMP" "LS_HighSide_V3_ST" "schematic"
WARNING (ADE-6003): Terminal "vdd3", specified in the CDF termOrder, does not exist
           in the cell-view "Stimulator_IMP" "LS_HighSide_V3_ST" "schematic"
WARNING (ADE-6003): Terminal "vdde", specified in the CDF termOrder, does not exist
           in the cell-view "Stimulator_IMP" "LS_HighSide_V3_ST" "schematic"
WARNING (ADE-6004): Mismatch was found between the terminals in the cellView and those on the
           termOrder property on the CDF. Because of the mismatch, the CDF termOrder will
           be ignored. The terminals in the cellView will be netlisted in the alphabetical
           order of their names. Eliminate the mismatch if you want the CDF termOrder
           property to be used for netlisting.
           To edit CDF of a cell, 
           i) Open CIW->Tools->CDF->Edit.
           ii) Select Library Name & Cell Name.
           iii) Click on the Edit button in the simulation information section of the
                Edit CDF window.
