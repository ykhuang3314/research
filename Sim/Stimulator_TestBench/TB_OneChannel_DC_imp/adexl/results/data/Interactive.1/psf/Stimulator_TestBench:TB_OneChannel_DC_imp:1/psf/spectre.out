Post-Transient Simulation Summary
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   -   To further speed up simulation, consider
          add ++aps on command line
   -   Non-default settings that could significantly slow down simulation
          errpreset = conservative, default moderate
          reltol = 10e-06, default 100e-06 (conservative)
   -   The circuit contains signals of the voltage > 10V, consider to set highvoltage=yes to get better accuracy and convergence ability.

Notice from spectre at time = 100 us during transient analysis `tran'.
    Newton iteration fails to converge at time = 100 us step = 2.00577 as.

DC Analysis `dcOp'

Opening the PSF file ../psf/dcOp.dc ...
Important parameter values:

Trying `homotopy = gmin'.

Notice from spectre during DC analysis `dcOp'.
    GminDC = 1 pS is large enough to noticeably affect the DC solution.
        dV(M16.m1:int_d) = -77.879 mV
        Use the `gmin_check' option to eliminate or expand this report.
    Bad pivoting is found during DC analysis. Option dc_pivot_check=yes is recommended for possible improvement of convergence.

Post-Transient Simulation Summary
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   -   To further speed up simulation, consider
          add ++aps on command line
   -   Non-default settings that could significantly slow down simulation
          errpreset = conservative, default moderate
          reltol = 10e-06, default 100e-06 (conservative)
   -   The circuit contains signals of the voltage > 10V, consider to set highvoltage=yes to get better accuracy and convergence ability.
