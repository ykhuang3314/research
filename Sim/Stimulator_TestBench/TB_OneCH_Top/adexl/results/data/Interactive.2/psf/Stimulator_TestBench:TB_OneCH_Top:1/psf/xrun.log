Number of accepted tran steps =             8604

Maximum value achieved for any signal of each quantity: 
V: V(TB_OneCH_Top.I0.I1.net07) = 41.32 V
I: I(TB_OneCH_Top.V2:p) = 42.88 mA
If your circuit contains signals of the same quantity that are vastly different in size (such as high voltage circuitry combined with low voltage control circuitry), you should consider specifying global option `bin_relref=yes'.

Post-Transient Simulation Summary
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   -   Non-default settings that could significantly slow down simulation
          errpreset = conservative_sigglobal, default moderate
          reltol = 10e-06, default 100e-06 (conservative)
   -   The circuit contains signals of the voltage > 10V, consider to set highvoltage=yes to get better accuracy and convergence ability.

Notice from spectre during IC analysis, during transient analysis `tran'.
    GminDC = 1 pS is large enough to noticeably affect the DC solution.

        Use the `gmin_check' option to eliminate or expand this report.
    Bad pivoting is found during DC analysis. Option dc_pivot_check=yes is recommended for possible improvement of convergence.

I: I(TB_OneCH_Top.V2:p) = 35.63 mA
If your circuit contains signals of the same quantity that are vastly different in size (such as high voltage circuitry combined with low voltage control circuitry), you should consider specifying global option `bin_relref=yes'.

Transient Analysis `tran': time = (0 s -> 2.5 ms)

Notice from spectre during IC analysis, during transient analysis `tran'.
    GminDC = 1 pS is large enough to noticeably affect the DC solution.
        dV(TB_OneCH_Top.I0.I1.M66.m1:int_d) = 178.582 mV
        Use the `gmin_check' option to eliminate or expand this report.
    Bad pivoting is found during DC analysis. Option dc_pivot_check=yes is recommended for possible improvement of convergence.

Maximum value achieved for any signal of each quantity: 
V: V(TB_OneCH_Top.I0.I2.net07) = 40.45 V
I: I(TB_OneCH_Top.V2:p) = 32.76 mA
If your circuit contains signals of the same quantity that are vastly different in size (such as high voltage circuitry combined with low voltage control circuitry), you should consider specifying global option `bin_relref=yes'.

          errpreset = conservative_sigglobal, default moderate
          reltol = 10e-06, default 100e-06 (conservative)
   -   The circuit contains signals of the voltage > 10V, consider to set highvoltage=yes to get better accuracy and convergence ability.
