   -   Non-default settings that could significantly slow down simulation
          errpreset = conservative, default moderate
          reltol = 10e-06, default 100e-06 (conservative)
   -   The circuit contains signals of the voltage > 10V, consider to set highvoltage=yes to get better accuracy and convergence ability.
