Warning from spectre at time = 842.967 us during transient analysis `tran'.
    WARNING (SPECTRE-16881): Detected possible convergence difficulties which might be related to Verilog-A models. Use the command-line option '-ahdllint=warn' to check the Verilog-A modeling issues.


The following set of suggestions might help you avoid convergence difficulties.  

 1. Evaluate and resolve any notice, warning, or error messages.
 2. Use realistic device models. Check all component parameters, particularly nonlinear device model parameters, to ensure that they are reasonable.
 3. Small floating resistors connected to high impedance nodes can cause convergence difficulties. Avoid very small floating resistors, particularly small parasitic resistors in semiconductors. Instead, use voltage sources or iprobes to measure current.
 4. Ensure that a complete set of parasitic capacitors is used on nonlinear devices to avoid jumps in the solution waveforms. On MOS models, specify nonzero source and drain areas.
 5. Perform sanity check on the parameter values by using the parameter range checker (use ``+param param-limits-file'' as a command line argument) and heed any warnings.  Print the minimum and maximum parameter value by using `info' analysis.  Ensure that the bounds given for instance, model, output, temperature-dependent, and operating-point (if possible) parameters are reasonable.

 6. Check the direction of both independent and dependent current sources. Convergence problems might result if current sources are connected such that they force current backward through diodes.

 7.  Enable diagnostic messages by setting option `diagnose=detailed'.
 8. Use the `cmin' parameter to install a small capacitor from every node in the circuit to ground.  This usually eliminates any jump in the solution.
 9. Loosen tolerances, particularly absolute tolerances like `iabstol' (on options statement). If tolerances are set too tight, they might preclude convergence.
10. Try to simplify the nonlinear component models to avoid regions that might contribute to convergence problems in the model.
