INFO (VLOGNET-60): The stimulus name mapped table will not be printed in the

"/home/ykhuang/research/Sim/TB_IA_EMG/ams/config/netlist/digital/testfixture.verilog" file. To print the stimulus name mapped table, set

simVerilogPrintStimulusNameMappingTable = t either in CIW or the .simrc file

before invoking Verilog netlister.
 
INFO (VLOGNET-62): Database internal net names will be printed for floating
instance ports. To prevent 
them from being printed, set
simVerilogProcessNullPorts = t either in CIW or 
the .simrc file.
 
INFO (VLOGNET-64): All cellviews in the design will be printed in the Netlist
Configuration list. 
If you want to print only those cellviews that need to be
re-netlisted in the 
list, set simVerilogIncrementalNetlistConfigList = t either
in CIW or the 
.simrc file.
 
INFO (VLOGNET-68): The initial state of stimulus of all inout pins is set to
"z". To get inout 
pins with initial state of "0", set
hnlVerilogIOInitStimulusStr = "0" 
either in CIW or the .simrc file.
 
INFO (AMS-2150): Generating the 'changedVarsSummary' file in the 'netlist'
directory. This file prints the values of the netlister control variables, which
are different from their default values. To disable the file creation, type
'envSetVal("ams.netlisterOpts" "print_control_vars" 'boolean nil )' in the
'.cdsinit' file.

INFO (VLOGNET-117): Re-netlisting the entire design.

INFO (VLOGNET-118): Using connection by name (explicit connections) for all
stopping and 
non-stopping cells.
 
WARNING (VLOGNET-110): The cell 'EMG_TestBench/TB_IA_EMG/schematic' has no
ports. Make sure that this was the intended 
design.
