Maximum value achieved for any signal of each quantity: 
V: V(TB_AFE_MEG.vdda) = 1.8 V
I: I(TB_AFE_MEG.V3:p) = 0 A
If your circuit contains signals of the same quantity that are vastly different
        in size (such as high voltage circuitry combined with low voltage
        control circuitry), you should consider specifying global option
        `bin_relref=yes'.
