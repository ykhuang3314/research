xmsim: *W,NCTERM: Simulation received SIGTERM signal from process 15589, user id 1004 (/pkg/cadence/installs/IC618/tools/bin/64bit/cdsServIpc).
    tran: time = 4.282 us   (85.6 m%), step = 2.145 us    (42.9 m%)
Number of accepted tran steps =             9

Maximum value achieved for any signal of each quantity: 
V: V(RAMP_ST) = 1.8 V
I: I(TB_Digital_Stimulus_EMG_NMES_V2.V5:p) = 0 A
If your circuit contains signals of the same quantity that are vastly different
        in size (such as high voltage circuitry combined with low voltage
        control circuitry), you should consider specifying global option
        `bin_relref=yes'.
