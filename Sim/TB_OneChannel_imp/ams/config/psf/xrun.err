Notice from spectre during IC analysis, during transient analysis `tran'.
    GminDC = 1 pS is large enough to noticeably affect the DC solution.

        Use the `gmin_check' option to eliminate or expand this report.
    Bad pivoting is found during DC analysis. Option dc_pivot_check=yes is
        recommended for possible improvement of convergence.

Maximum value achieved for any signal of each quantity: 
V: V(TB_OneChannel_imp.vddh) = 40 V
I: I(TB_OneChannel_imp.V3:p) = 20 uA
If your circuit contains signals of the same quantity that are vastly different
        in size (such as high voltage circuitry combined with low voltage
        control circuitry), you should consider specifying global option
        `bin_relref=yes'.

Post-Transient Simulation Summary
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   -   DC analysis takes more than half of total simulation time. To speed up,
        consider
          add +fastdc on command line
          reuse previous ic file
   -   Non-default settings that could significantly slow down simulation
          errpreset = conservative_sigglobal, default moderate
          reltol = 10e-06, default 100e-06 (conservative)
   -   The circuit contains signals of the voltage > 10V, consider to set
        highvoltage=yes to get better accuracy and convergence ability.
