Trying `homotopy = gmin'.



Notice from spectre during DC analysis `dcOp'.
    GminDC = 1 pS is large enough to noticeably affect the DC solution.

        dV(I29.M4.m1:int_d) = 21.9669 mV

        Use the `gmin_check' option to eliminate or expand this report.



Maximum value achieved for any signal of each quantity: 

V: V(vddh) = 40 V

I: I(V0:p) = 40.94 mA

Convergence achieved in 524 iterations.
